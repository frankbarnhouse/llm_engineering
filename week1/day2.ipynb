These creatures were known for their ability to quickly detect their主人 after hours of searching in the dense forests. The homingcat is smaller than most catfish and, in 2017, there were reports of their appearance in several different species of river banks across North America. Today, homingcats are recognized as part of the Homometrya order, along with other small pocket cats.\""
